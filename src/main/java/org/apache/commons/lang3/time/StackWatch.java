/**
 * <p>
 * The {@code StackWatch}, provides a wrapper around the {@code StopWatch} for creating multiple and
 * possibly nested named timings.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * While the {@code StopWatch} provides functionality to time the length of operations, there is no
 * context or name to go with the time tracked. It is also not possible to time nested calls with
 * the {@code StopWatch}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * {@code StackWatch} provides that functionality, allowing successive calls to {@link StackWatch#startTiming(String, String...)} to track
 * nested calls.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Each start provides a timing name and a parent timing name, thus providing context to the timing.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * At the end of a timing 'run', a visitor interface provides the ability to visit all the timing
 * 'nodes' and capture their output, including the level of the call if nested.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@code TimeRecordNodes} provide a tree structure in support of nesting.
 * A {@code Deque} is use to track the current time node.
 * </p>
